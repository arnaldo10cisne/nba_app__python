    Program created by Arnaldo Cisneros, as part of a technical test provided by Macheight. 

    This program extracts data on several professional NBA players, and given a positive integer
    supplied by the user, the program is capable of creating pairs of players, in such a way that
    their heights in inches add up to the number supplied by the user.

    The data is gathered from: https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/

    Developed in the city of Medell√≠n, Colombia. November, 2021.
